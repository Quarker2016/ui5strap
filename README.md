ui5strap
========

UI5Strap is an OpenUI5 library for creating responsive websites and apps using the markup and style of Bootstrap 3.1.1.

The UI5Strap library also contains a basic example application that you can use as a starting point for your responsive website or app.

PRE-RELEASE STATE
-----------------

Ui5Strap is currently in a pre-release state and so it's currently unversioned. Please always check out the Ui5Strap documentation at http://ui5strap.com/docs/ for the latest changes. Until the first release, the online documentation will always reflect the current state of the repository.

UPCOMING CHANGES
----------------

If you decide to use the library in the current pre-relase state, please prepare yourself that the package name "de_pksoftware.ui5strap" will change to "ui5strap" step by step. Also, the sub packages (controls, form, ex) will be removed then. This means that you will have to refactor your code if you decide to update the library. Please always check the documentation for the latest changes.
