ui5strap
========

UI5Strap is an OpenUI5 library for creating responsive websites and apps using the markup and style of Bootstrap 3.

Therefore, the library contains one OpenUI5 control for each bootstrap component.

The UI5Strap library also contains a basic example application that you can use as a starting point for your responsive website or app.

Please note: Some of the bootstrap components still need to be implemented as control in UI5Strap. Please take a look at the existing controls to learn how to create customs controls.
